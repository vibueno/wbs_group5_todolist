### Guidelines

- [CSS Rule order](https://9elements.com/css-rule-order)
- [Git set-up and workflow](./doc/git.md)
- Use [JS Doc](https://jsdoc.app/) to document JS

### Helpers

- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/): the file _.prettierrc.json_ in the root folder of the project makes sure everyone uses the same code formatter settings. You need to [install Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html) for your code editor. Prettier can run 'on file save', so that you don't need to run it manually. Look for instructions on how to set it up in your code editor.

- [JSHint](https://jshint.com/): the file _.jshintrc_ in the root folder of the project makes sure we all validate our JS using the same settings. You need to [install JSHint](https://jshint.com/install/) for your code editor.

### Validators

These validators, even if not 100% up-to-date with the newest standards, still help in most cases:

- [HTML (W3C)](https://validator.w3.org)
- [CSS (W3C)](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator)
